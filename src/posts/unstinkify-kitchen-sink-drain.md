Make a homemade drain cleaner by following these steps:

1. Mix 1/2 cup baking soda with 1/4 cup table salt.
2. Pour the mixture down the drain.
3. Pour 1 cup heated vinegar down your drain; the concoction is going to foam and bubble.
4. Let the solution stand for 15 minutes (longer does not work any better).
5. Run hot tap water in the drain for at least 15 to 30 seconds.

If an odor persists, it’s possible that your drain is clogged. Difficult clogs continue releasing odors until they’re completely removed from the drain plumbing. With caution, try pouring the vinegar directly into your drain. But beware: The acidity of vinegar could damage certain sink surfaces.
